      <p>In the UK, 3.5 million people have Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), with uncontrolled diabetes and high blood pressure being the biggest causes. Over 68,000 people in the UK are currently being treated for kidney failure, and there are 40-45,000 premature deaths every year due to CKD. Black, Asian, and minority ethnic communities are five times more likely to develop CKD. Every day, 20 people in the UK develop kidney failure, and there are around 1,000 children with CKD in the UK. Because of this calculate your eGFR today!</p>
